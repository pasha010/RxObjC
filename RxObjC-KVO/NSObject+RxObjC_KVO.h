/**
 * KVO is a tricky mechanism.
 *
 * When observing child in a ownership hierarchy, usually retaining observing target is wanted behavior.
 * When observing parent in a ownership hierarchy, usually retaining target isn't wanter behavior.
 *
 * KVO with weak references is especially tricky. For it to work, some kind of swizzling is required.
 * That can be done by
 *     * replacing object class dynamically (like KVO does)
 *     * by swizzling `dealloc` method on all instances for a class.
 *     * some third method ...
 *
 * Both approaches can fail in certain scenarios:
 *     * problems arise when swizzlers return original object class (like KVO does when nobody is observing)
 *     * Problems can arise because replacing dealloc method isn't atomic operation (get implementation, set implementation).
 *
 * Second approach is chosen. It can fail in case there are multiple libraries dynamically trying
 * to replace dealloc method. In case that isn't the case, it should be ok.

/**
 * Observes values on `keyPath` starting from `self` with `options` and retains `self` if `retainSelf` is set.
 * `rx_observe` is just a simple and performant wrapper around KVO mechanism.
 *
 *  * it can be used to observe paths starting from `self` or from ancestors in ownership graph (`retainSelf = false`)
 *  * it can be used to observe paths starting from descendants in ownership graph (`retainSelf = true`)
 *  * the paths have to consist only of `strong` properties, otherwise you are risking crashing the system by not unregistering KVO observer before dealloc.
 *
 * If support for weak properties is needed or observing arbitrary or unknown relationships in the
 * ownership tree, `rx_observeWeakly` is the preferred option.
 * @param keyPath Key path of property names to observe.
 * @param options KVO mechanism notification options.
 * @param retainSelf Retains self during observation if set `true`.
 * @return Observable sequence of objects on `keyPath`.
